Its API is an almost complete copy of the HTML5 Canvas API, with some additions and subtractions.\n\n\nSome comments for my own; don't you mind about them.\n\n1. Use `context.translate(0.5, 0.5) for anti-aliasing.\n\n2. Use a singleton pattern to implement Draw. `Draw.getInstance()` returns the DrawInstance.\n\n3. Expose `translate`, 'transform`, etc. on Draw (not on DrawInstance).\n\n4. Always reset the properties that could harm the next object and call `closePath()` before drawing the next object.",

Positions of polygons are the positions of the top left corner of their AABB. For circles and arcs, it is the position of their center.\n\n> __Note:__ Some objects should be drawn within a certain space. Make sure to check `Draw.width/height` before you draw something.",
