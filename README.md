2d
==

2D is the fully Open-Source, webbased 2D game engine, by GOAT! studios. Feel free to study, use, alter and redistribute this code!




### What's the state of 2D at the moment?

At this moment, we are just defining the API that will make up the final engine, hopefully in the not too distant future. We already gather quite some knowledge from the first version, [Game2Go](https://github.com/TuurDutoit/game2go). All the API docs can be found in the `docs` directory, but no code has already been written (although some parts will be copied from Game2Go).




### Folder Structure

* In the `src` directory, all the source code can be found. It is divided in two main parts, `core` (the core engine) and `plugins` (the basic plugins).
* In `test`, all the test pages are located. We try to keep them updated, but with a rapidly changing API and code being so young, this can be tedious job, so bear with us!
* In the `dist` directory, we store all the (combined and minified) major version of the engine.
* In `docs`, you can find all the documentation (hopefully updated)
* And finally, in `examples`, you can find some examples, that demo some awesome features of 2D. Until the engine matures a bit, you probably won't find anything in there.




### Don't forget!

You're totally free to use this code, alter as you wish and, most importantly, to contribute to this project! Happy coding!
